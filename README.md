# Simulation Modeling for Patient No-Show Loss Reduction - AD 616 Final Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a simulation model to reduce losses caused by patient no-shows in a Brazilian hospital.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to analyze patient no-show data and hospital charges to devise strategies that minimize financial losses. This involves:
- Conducting background research on patient no-show rates and their financial impact on healthcare systems.
- Developing a framework for the analysis and simulation modeling.
- Formulating research questions and problems.
- Performing detailed methodological analysis.
- Proposing recommendations and discussing business implications.

## Key Components
- **Background Research**: Examination of existing literature and data on patient no-shows.
- **Framework Development**: Establishing a structure for the analysis and simulation process.
- **Research Questions**: Identifying key issues and areas for investigation.
- **Methodology and Analysis**: Utilizing data analytics and simulation modeling to understand and address the issue of patient no-shows.
- **Recommendations**: Providing actionable insights and strategies for healthcare providers to mitigate financial losses due to no-shows.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- Data Analysis and Simulation Software (e.g., R, Python, specialized simulation tools)
- Microsoft PowerPoint for the final presentation.
